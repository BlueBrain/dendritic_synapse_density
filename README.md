# dendritic_synapse_density

Extraction of dendritic synapses per unit length for each neuron of a given circuit:

* __[/bin](/bin)__\
  Python scripts to extracts dendritic EXC and INH synapse densities (#synapses/um) for each neuron. The resulting cell table is written to file as pickled Pandas dataframe.
* __[/notebooks](/notebooks)__\
  Jupyter notebooks for loading a pre-computed cell table and running various analyses and visualizations
